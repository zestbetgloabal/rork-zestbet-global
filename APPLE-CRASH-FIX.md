# Apple Review Crash Fix

## Issue Identified
The app was crashing due to complex regular expressions in the Hermes JavaScript engine causing memory corruption. The crash occurred in `hermes::vm::JSObject::setNamedSlotValueUnsafe` during regex operations.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Replaced Complex Regex Patterns
- **File**: `utils/helpers.ts`
- **Issue**: Complex email and phone validation regex patterns were causing crashes
- **Fix**: Replaced with simple string manipulation methods that avoid regex entirely

**Before (Problematic)**:
```javascript
const re = /^(([^<>()\\[\\]\\\\.,;:\\s@"]+(\\.[^<>()\\[\\]\\\\.,;:\\s@"]+)*)|(".+"))@((\\[[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}])|(([a-zA-Z\\-0-9]+\\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/;
```

**After (Safe)**:
```javascript
// Simple email validation to avoid regex crashes in Hermes
const emailParts = email.toLowerCase().split('@');
if (emailParts.length !== 2) return false;
// ... additional simple string checks
```

### 2. Added Error Boundaries
- **File**: `app/_layout.tsx`
- **Added**: React Error Boundary to catch and handle any remaining crashes gracefully
- **Benefit**: App will show error screen instead of crashing completely

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- **File**: `app/_layout.tsx`
- **Improved**: Font loading error handling to not throw errors
- **Added**: Better async error handling with `.catch(console.error)`

## Testing
The app has been tested with the problematic regex patterns removed. The validation functions now use simple string operations that are safe in the Hermes JavaScript engine.

## Production Safety
- All regex patterns have been audited and replaced with safe alternatives
- Error boundaries catch any unexpected crashes
- Sentry integration provides crash reporting for production monitoring

The app should now be stable and pass Apple's review process without the regex-related crashes.
