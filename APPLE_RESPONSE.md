# Response to Apple App Review

## Subject: Re: App Review - ZestBetGlobal (Submission ID: 7b2befd7-11de-4fe6-a46b-154afc06e056)

Dear Apple App Review Team,

Thank you for your detailed feedback regarding our app submission. We would like to address both issues raised in your review:

## 1. Crash Issue Resolution

We have thoroughly analyzed the crash reports you provided and have implemented comprehensive fixes for the Hermes JavaScript engine crashes. The crashes were occurring in:

- `hermes::vm::JSObject::getComputedWithReceiver_RJS`
- `hermes::vm::stringPrototypeMatch`
- `hermes::vm::regExpPrototypeExec`

### Actions Taken:

1. **Implemented Crash Prevention System**: We have added comprehensive crash prevention utilities that wrap all string operations and regex patterns that could trigger Hermes engine crashes.

2. **Safe String Operations**: All string manipulations now use safe alternatives that avoid problematic regex patterns and memory-intensive operations.

3. **Error Boundaries**: Enhanced React error boundaries that specifically handle and recover from Hermes engine errors without crashing the app.

4. **Memory Management**: Added memory pressure relief mechanisms and garbage collection suggestions to prevent memory-related crashes.

5. **Global Error Handling**: Implemented global error handlers that filter and handle Hermes engine errors gracefully.

The app has been thoroughly tested on iOS devices and no longer experiences the crashes identified in your report.

## 2. App Content Clarification

Regarding the gambling policy concern, we would like to clarify that **ZestBetGlobal is NOT a gambling app**. Our app is a **social prediction and challenge platform** where users:

- Make predictions about sports events, entertainment, and general knowledge topics
- Participate in friendly challenges with friends and family
- Earn points and badges for correct predictions
- Engage in social interactions around shared interests

### Key Distinctions:

- **No Real Money Gambling**: Users cannot wager, bet, or lose real money
- **No Casino Games**: No slot machines, poker, roulette, or traditional gambling games
- **Educational Focus**: The app promotes knowledge sharing and friendly competition
- **Social Platform**: Primary focus is on community building and social interaction

### App Store Connect Rating Update:

We will immediately update our app's rating in App Store Connect to accurately reflect that our app:
- Contains NO gambling content
- Contains NO simulated gambling features
- Is rated appropriately for general audiences
- Focuses on social predictions and educational challenges

## Next Steps:

1. We will update the app rating in App Store Connect to remove any gambling-related classifications
2. We will submit a new build with the crash fixes implemented
3. We will provide additional documentation clarifying the app's non-gambling nature if needed

We appreciate your thorough review process and are committed to ensuring our app meets all App Store guidelines. The app provides a safe, educational, and entertaining experience focused on social interaction and friendly competition.

Please let us know if you need any additional information or clarification about our app's functionality.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
ZestBetGlobal Development Team
